# NHPO admin

This repo contains some scripts to facilitate admin tasks for the treasurer of
the orkest.

## usage

The `bank-transaction-read.sh` script can be used to
create a csv overview from the bank account that can
be imported into a spreadsheet for the annual meeting presentation or
municipal subsidy.

After changing the bank-transaction-read files, run install to install them.

## example

```bash
bank-transaction-read.sh NL89INGB0003788111_01-01-2022_31-12-2022.csv
```
